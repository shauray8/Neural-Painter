the size is [512, 512] because i was out of vram so i had to do this on my i5 10gen [SAD]

---
i think i can make a webapp for style transfer with transfering style with respect to 
the artist of choice like 

Albrecht DÃ¼rer <br/>
Alfred Sisley<br/>
Amedeo Modigliani<br/>
Andrei Rublev<br/>
Andy Warhol<br/>
Camille Pissarro<br/>
Caravaggio<br/>
Claude Monet<br/>
Diego Rivera<br/>
Diego Velazquez<br/>
Edgar Degas<br/>
Edouard Manet<br/>
Edvard Munch<br/>
El Greco<br/>
Eugene Delacroix<br/>
Francisco Goya<br/>
Frida Kahlo<br/>
Georges Seurat<br/>

and more ...
